# Poopy-Discord-Theme
My discord theme :P

Just download the file called "Poppy's Theme.css" and put it in your themes folder

This theme allows background images but a few steps are required to do so

1:
Go down to line 49 (--theme-background-image) and upload your image url

2:
Your discord is going to look something like this:

To fix this we're going to change the opacity on the background color to make it appear invisible

3:
Go to line 48 (--bg-4)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98a9cab2-0b32-4613-99de-b7b4807aed18)

Now change the 4th number within the brackets from "1" to "0"

And now your background image should appear

To remove the image just follow the steps in reverse and your theme should go back to normal!!!

thanks 4 reading and using my theme ◝(＾▽＾)◜
